## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/go-solar.git
   cd go-solar
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mstephenholl/go-solar.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Make (optional, but recommended)
- Git

### Install Development Tools

```bash
make install-tools
```

This will install (with interactive confirmation):
- **golangci-lint** (v2.5.0) - Comprehensive linter suite (installed via binary for speed)
- **staticcheck** - Static analysis tool
- **goimports** - Import formatter and organizer
- **govulncheck** - Vulnerability scanner

To install without confirmation:
```bash
make install-tools-force
```

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
make ci-quick
```

This runs formatting checks, vet, and tests (fastest validation).

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-calculation`
- `fix/correct-polar-cases`
- `docs/update-examples`
- `refactor/improve-performance`

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Document complex algorithms
- Keep functions focused and small

### Writing Code

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following these guidelines:
   - Write clear, concise code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Follow existing code patterns

3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new calculation method"
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `enhancement`: Improvement to existing feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(elevation): add support for custom elevation angles
enhancement(nmea): improve parsing performance by 30%
fix(hourangle): correct polar night calculation
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(sunrise): add edge case tests for polar regions
```

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run Tests with Coverage

```bash
make coverage
```

This generates a coverage report in `coverage/coverage.html`.

### Run Benchmarks

```bash
make test-bench
```

### Writing Tests

- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test edge cases (polar regions, extreme dates, etc.)
- Aim for 100% coverage on new code
- Use descriptive test names
- Add example tests for documentation

**Example:**

```go
func TestNewFunction(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    float64
        expected float64
    }{
        {"zero", 0.0, 0.0},
        {"positive", 5.0, 25.0},
        {"negative", -5.0, 25.0},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got := NewFunction(tt.input)
            if !AlmostEqual(got, tt.expected, 1e-10) {
                t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", got, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Code Quality

### Format Code

```bash
make fmt
```

### Run Linters

```bash
make lint
```

### Run Security Checks

```bash
make security
```

### Development Workflow Guide

We provide multiple make targets for different stages of development:

| Target | Purpose | Modifies Files? | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`make ci-quick`** | Fast validation | ❌ No | Every 5-10 minutes during development |
| **`make pre-commit`** | Auto-fix & validate | ✅ Yes (formats code) | Right before committing |
| **`make ci`** | Complete checks | ❌ No | Automated validation, CI simulation |
| **`make ci-local`** | Full CI simulation | ❌ No | Before creating PR, debugging CI failures |
| **`make pre-release`** | Release validation | ❌ No | Before tagging releases |

#### Detailed Comparison

**`make ci-quick`** (⚡ Fastest)
```bash
make ci-quick
```
- Runs: `fmt-check` → `vet` → `test`
- No linting, no coverage report
- Use for quick iteration during development

**`make pre-commit`** (🔧 Auto-fix)
```bash
make pre-commit
```
- Runs: `fmt` → `vet` → `test`
- **Auto-formats your code** (modifies files)
- Use right before `git commit` or as a git hook
- Difference from `ci-quick`: Uses `fmt` instead of `fmt-check`

**`make ci`** (✅ Complete)
```bash
make ci
```
- Runs: `deps-verify` → `fmt-check` → `vet` → `lint` → `test-coverage`
- Comprehensive validation without modifying files
- Fast, minimal output
- Use in automated scripts or for quick complete validation

**`make ci-local`** (📋 Verbose)
```bash
make ci-local
```
- Runs: `deps` → `deps-verify` → `vet` → `fmt-check` → `test-coverage` → `lint`
- Shows step-by-step progress
- Matches GitHub Actions CI workflow exactly
- Use before creating PRs or when debugging CI failures

**`make pre-release`** (🚀 Release-ready)
```bash
make pre-release
```
- Runs: `clean` → `ci` → `security`
- Removes build artifacts, runs full CI, adds security scanning
- Use before tagging releases or merging to master

### Typical Development Cycle

```bash
# 1. While writing code (fast iteration)
make ci-quick

# 2. Before committing (auto-format and validate)
make pre-commit

# 3. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# 4. Before pushing (final validation)
make ci-local

# 5. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pre-PR Validation

Before submitting a PR, validate your changes locally using make commands:

#### Quick Validation (Recommended)

```bash
make ci-quick
```

This runs:
- Code formatting check
- `go vet`
- Tests

#### Full CI Simulation

```bash
make ci-local
```

This simulates the complete GitHub Actions CI pipeline:
1. Downloads dependencies
2. Verifies dependencies
3. Runs `go vet`
4. Checks code formatting with `goimports`
5. Runs tests with coverage
6. Runs full linter suite

**✅ If `make ci-local` passes, your PR will pass CI!**

#### Individual Checks

If you need to run specific checks:

```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Check formatting (without modifying files)
make fmt-check

# Run tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage report
make coverage

# Run linter
make lint

# Run security checks
make security

# Run benchmarks
make test-bench
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Validate locally:**
   ```bash
   make ci-local
   ```

2. **Update your branch with the latest upstream:**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

3. **Push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request on GitHub**

5. **Ensure all CI checks pass** (they should if `make ci-local` passed!)

6. **Wait for review and address feedback**

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Include test results if applicable
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure CI passes
- Keep PRs focused (one feature/fix per PR)

## Release Process

Releases are **fully automated** - you don't need to create tags or manage versions!

### How It Works

When your PR is merged to `master`:

**Phase 1: CI Quality Gates** (must all pass)
1. ✅ Tests run across multiple OS platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
2. ✅ Tests run across multiple Go versions (1.21, 1.22, 1.23)
3. ✅ Linter validates code quality (golangci-lint)
4. ✅ Security scans run (gosec, govulncheck)
5. ✅ Build verifies the package compiles
6. ✅ Benchmarks execute successfully

**Phase 2: Release Creation** (only if Phase 1 passes)
7. 🏷️ GitHub Actions automatically creates a CalVer version tag
8. 📝 Changelog is generated from commit messages
9. 🎉 GitHub release is created with notes

**Quality First:** The release workflow only triggers after all CI quality gates pass successfully. If any CI check fails, no release is created.

**You don't need to do anything!** Just merge to master and the process is fully automated.

### Versioning

We use **[Calendar Versioning (CalVer)](https://calver.org/)**:

**Format:** `YYYY.MM.MICRO`

- `YYYY` - Full year (e.g., 2025)
- `MM` - Zero-padded month (01-12)
- `MICRO` - Incrementing number for releases within the same month (0, 1, 2, ...)

**Examples:**
- `v2025.10.0` - First release in October 2025
- `v2025.10.1` - Second release in October 2025
- `v2025.11.0` - First release in November 2025

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Chronologically sortable and human-readable
- ✅ Clear release timing (same format as Ubuntu)
- ✅ Handles multiple releases per month properly
- ✅ No manual version management
- ✅ Industry-standard CalVer format
