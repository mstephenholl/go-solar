## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/go-solar.git
   cd go-solar
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mstephenholl/go-solar.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Make (optional, but recommended)
- Git

### Install Development Tools

```bash
make install-tools
```

This will install (with interactive confirmation):
- **golangci-lint** (v2.5.0) - Comprehensive linter suite (installed via binary for speed)
- **staticcheck** - Static analysis tool
- **goimports** - Import formatter and organizer
- **govulncheck** - Vulnerability scanner

To install without confirmation:
```bash
make install-tools-force
```

### Verify Your Setup

```bash
make ci-quick
```

This runs formatting checks, vet, and tests (fastest validation).

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-calculation`
- `fix/correct-polar-cases`
- `docs/update-examples`
- `refactor/improve-performance`

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Document complex algorithms
- Keep functions focused and small

### Writing Code

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following these guidelines:
   - Write clear, concise code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Follow existing code patterns

3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new calculation method"
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `enhancement`: Improvement to existing feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(elevation): add support for custom elevation angles
enhancement(nmea): improve parsing performance by 30%
fix(hourangle): correct polar night calculation
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(sunrise): add edge case tests for polar regions
```

## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run Tests with Coverage

```bash
make coverage
```

This generates a coverage report in `coverage/coverage.html`.

### Run Benchmarks

```bash
make test-bench
```

### Writing Tests

- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test edge cases (polar regions, extreme dates, etc.)
- Aim for 100% coverage on new code
- Use descriptive test names
- Add example tests for documentation

**Example:**

```go
func TestNewFunction(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    float64
        expected float64
    }{
        {"zero", 0.0, 0.0},
        {"positive", 5.0, 25.0},
        {"negative", -5.0, 25.0},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got := NewFunction(tt.input)
            if !AlmostEqual(got, tt.expected, 1e-10) {
                t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", got, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Code Quality

### Format Code

```bash
make fmt
```

### Run Linters

```bash
make lint
```

### Run Security Checks

```bash
make security
```

### Development Workflow Guide

We provide multiple make targets for different stages of development:

| Target | Purpose | Modifies Files? | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`make ci-quick`** | Fast validation | ‚ùå No | Every 5-10 minutes during development |
| **`make pre-commit`** | Auto-fix & validate | ‚úÖ Yes (formats code) | Right before committing |
| **`make ci`** | Complete checks | ‚ùå No | Automated validation, CI simulation |
| **`make ci-local`** | Full CI simulation | ‚ùå No | Before creating PR, debugging CI failures |
| **`make pre-release`** | Release validation | ‚ùå No | Before tagging releases |

#### Detailed Comparison

**`make ci-quick`** (‚ö° Fastest)
```bash
make ci-quick
```
- Runs: `fmt-check` ‚Üí `vet` ‚Üí `test`
- No linting, no coverage report
- Use for quick iteration during development

**`make pre-commit`** (üîß Auto-fix)
```bash
make pre-commit
```
- Runs: `fmt` ‚Üí `vet` ‚Üí `test`
- **Auto-formats your code** (modifies files)
- Use right before `git commit` or as a git hook
- Difference from `ci-quick`: Uses `fmt` instead of `fmt-check`

**`make ci`** (‚úÖ Complete)
```bash
make ci
```
- Runs: `deps-verify` ‚Üí `fmt-check` ‚Üí `vet` ‚Üí `lint` ‚Üí `test-coverage`
- Comprehensive validation without modifying files
- Fast, minimal output
- Use in automated scripts or for quick complete validation

**`make ci-local`** (üìã Verbose)
```bash
make ci-local
```
- Runs: `deps` ‚Üí `deps-verify` ‚Üí `vet` ‚Üí `fmt-check` ‚Üí `test-coverage` ‚Üí `lint`
- Shows step-by-step progress
- Matches GitHub Actions CI workflow exactly
- Use before creating PRs or when debugging CI failures

**`make pre-release`** (üöÄ Release-ready)
```bash
make pre-release
```
- Runs: `clean` ‚Üí `ci` ‚Üí `security`
- Removes build artifacts, runs full CI, adds security scanning
- Use before tagging releases or merging to master

### Typical Development Cycle

```bash
# 1. While writing code (fast iteration)
make ci-quick

# 2. Before committing (auto-format and validate)
make pre-commit

# 3. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# 4. Before pushing (final validation)
make ci-local

# 5. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pre-PR Validation

Before submitting a PR, validate your changes locally using make commands:

#### Quick Validation (Recommended)

```bash
make ci-quick
```

This runs:
- Code formatting check
- `go vet`
- Tests

#### Full CI Simulation

```bash
make ci-local
```

This simulates the complete GitHub Actions CI pipeline:
1. Downloads dependencies
2. Verifies dependencies
3. Runs `go vet`
4. Checks code formatting with `goimports`
5. Runs tests with coverage
6. Runs full linter suite

**‚úÖ If `make ci-local` passes, your PR will pass CI!**

#### Individual Checks

If you need to run specific checks:

```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Check formatting (without modifying files)
make fmt-check

# Run tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage report
make coverage

# Run linter
make lint

# Run security checks
make security

# Run benchmarks
make test-bench
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Validate locally:**
   ```bash
   make ci-local
   ```

2. **Update your branch with the latest upstream:**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

3. **Push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request on GitHub**

5. **Ensure all CI checks pass** (they should if `make ci-local` passed!)

6. **Wait for review and address feedback**

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Reference any related issues
- Include test results if applicable
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure CI passes
- Keep PRs focused (one feature/fix per PR)

## Release Process

Releases are **fully automated** - you don't need to create tags or manage versions!

### How It Works

When your PR is merged to `master`:

**Phase 1: CI Quality Gates** (must all pass)
1. ‚úÖ Tests run across multiple OS platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
2. ‚úÖ Tests run across multiple Go versions (1.21, 1.22, 1.23)
3. ‚úÖ Linter validates code quality (golangci-lint)
4. ‚úÖ Security scans run (gosec, govulncheck)
5. ‚úÖ Build verifies the package compiles
6. ‚úÖ Benchmarks execute successfully

**Phase 2: Release Creation** (only if Phase 1 passes)
7. üè∑Ô∏è GitHub Actions automatically creates a CalVer version tag
8. üìù Changelog is generated from commit messages
9. üéâ GitHub release is created with notes

**Quality First:** The release workflow only triggers after all CI quality gates pass successfully. If any CI check fails, no release is created.

**You don't need to do anything!** Just merge to master and the process is fully automated.

### Versioning

We use **[Calendar Versioning (CalVer)](https://calver.org/)**:

**Format:** `YYYY.MM.MICRO`

- `YYYY` - Full year (e.g., 2025)
- `MM` - Zero-padded month (01-12)
- `MICRO` - Incrementing number for releases within the same month (0, 1, 2, ...)

**Examples:**
- `v2025.10.0` - First release in October 2025
- `v2025.10.1` - Second release in October 2025
- `v2025.11.0` - First release in November 2025

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Chronologically sortable and human-readable
- ‚úÖ Clear release timing (same format as Ubuntu)
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple releases per month properly
- ‚úÖ No manual version management
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard CalVer format
